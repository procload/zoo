      <h1>Welcome to the Cincinnati Zoo!</h1>
      <p>The Zoological Society of Cincinnati was founded in 1873 and officially opened its doors in 1875, making the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden the second oldest Zoo in the United States. The Zoo’s original animal collection was very small, originally consisting of just eight monkeys, two grizzly bears, three deer, six raccoons, two elk, a buffalo, a hyena, a tiger, an alligator, a circus elephant, and over four hundred birds, including a talking crow. The Zoo was founded on 65 acres in the middle of the city, and since then has acquired some of the surrounding blocks and several reserves in Cincinnati’s suburbs. Currently, we have 5 awesome animals for you to learn about, and they are listed below.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://scotthysell.wixsite.com/myelephants">Elephants!</a></h3>
          <p>An elephant is a large mammal found throughout Africa and Asia.  They have several distinctive features, the most notable is a long trunk used for breathing, lifting water and grasping objects.  Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://peterhuisman2.wixsite.com/eaglefans">Eagles!</a></h3>
          <p>Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://namelessitguy.wixsite.com/cheetah">Cheetahs!</a></h3>
          <p>The cheetah is the world’s fastest land animal and Africa’s most endangered big cat. Uniquely adapted for speed, the cheetah is capable of reaching speeds greater than 110 kilometers per hour in just over 3 seconds, and at top speed their stride is 7 meters long. With its long legs and very slender body, the cheetah is quite different from all other cats and is the only member of its genus, Acinonyx. The cheetah’s unique morphology and physiology allow it to attain the extreme speeds for which it’s famous, and is often referred to as the greyhound of cats.</p>
